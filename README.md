# Finance Playground 📈

Welcome to my **Finance Playground**, a simple collection of notebooks to explore working with financial data in Python.

_This file was mainly autogenerated using GPT-4-turbo._

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice financial analysis in Python using real data from Yahoo Finance
- Visualize time series like a responsible economist
- Sanction random stuff like a less responsible politician
- Confuse hiring managers

## 🛠️ Features
- Notebook: `01_downloading_data.ipynb` – Where serious charts meet unserious sanctions. We test the yfinance library and visualize simple S&P data.

## 🚀 Setup

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management.

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ```

2. **Install dependencies from the lock file:**

    ```bash
    uv pip sync
    ```

    If you don't have a lock file yet, install from `pyproject.toml`:

    ```bash
    uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
    ```
